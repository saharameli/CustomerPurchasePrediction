# CustomerPurchasePrediction
This project aims to predict customer behavior and determine whether a customer will make a purchase based on certain features. The prediction is made using the Logistic Regression algorithm, a statistical 
method commonly used for binary classification tasks. The dataset used in this project contains customer attributes, and the goal is to predict whether each customer will make a purchase (1) or not (0).
